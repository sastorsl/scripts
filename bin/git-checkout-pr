# Usage: `git checkout-pr <pull-request-id>`
#
# Make this file executable and place in a $PATH directory
# The name of the file is important. It has to be named `git-checkout-pr` for the usage to be `git checkout-pr`

# Every pull request on stash has 2 branches. One is called `merge` which is a branch that is merged with its destination.
# The other is `from` which is the unmodified revision that was pushed. This script checks out the merge branch.
# If you want to checkout the pr that is not pre-merged with it's destination, change all occurances of `merge` to `from`
